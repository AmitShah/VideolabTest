Version dependency
------------------

Currently this project uses [videolab-1.0] that is compatible with OP-Z iOS app
v1.0.x.

[videolab-1.0]: https://github.com/teenageengineering/videolab/releases/tag/v1.0

Note that Unity 5.6 is required to build videopaks with it.

This repository doesn't contain videolab files. You have to manually install
videolab when editing the examples on Unity.

Try them without Unity

You can try the videopaks without Unity.

1. Download zipped videopaks from the [Releases] page.
2. Connect an iOS device to Mac and open it on iTunes.
3. Open the File Sharing page and select OP-Z from the Apps list.
4. Drag and drop the extracted videopaks folder into the Documents pane.
